I'm Giorgi Iremashvili, a humanistic and existential therapist based in Tbilisi.

I work with people who are navigating life transitions, searching for meaning, or simply feeling stuck. My clients include expats adjusting to life in Georgia, international professionals, and Georgians who want a therapeutic space that goes beyond quick fixes.

Therapy isn't about having the right answers. It's about creating a space where you can think honestly, feel what you're feeling, and begin to understand the patterns that shape your life. My approach draws on the humanistic and existential tradition — the work of Carl Rogers, Rollo May, Viktor Frankl, and Irvin Yalom — which sees you as a whole person with the capacity for growth and self-awareness.

Sessions are available in English and Georgian, online or in-person in Tbilisi.
