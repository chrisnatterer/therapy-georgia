Humanistic and existential therapy didn't emerge in a vacuum. It grew out of a deep dissatisfaction with the dominant approaches of the mid-20th century — behaviorism, which reduced human experience to stimulus and response, and psychoanalysis, which often positioned the therapist as the expert decoding a patient's unconscious mind.

A group of thinkers believed there had to be a better way. They wanted an approach that took the whole person seriously — their freedom, their search for meaning, their capacity for growth.

## The Existential Roots

The philosophical groundwork was laid by existentialist thinkers like **Søren Kierkegaard**, **Friedrich Nietzsche**, **Martin Heidegger**, and **Jean-Paul Sartre**. Their central concern was the human condition itself: What does it mean to exist? How do we face freedom, responsibility, and death?

**Rollo May** (1909–1994) was one of the first to bring existential philosophy into the therapy room. His book *Love and Will* (1969) explored how anxiety isn't a disorder to be eliminated but a natural response to the challenges of being alive. May argued that confronting anxiety — rather than avoiding it — is the path to a more authentic life.

**Viktor Frankl** (1905–1997), an Austrian psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor, developed **logotherapy**, a form of existential therapy centered on the search for meaning. His memoir *Man's Search for Meaning* remains one of the most widely read books on human resilience. Frankl's core insight was simple but profound: even in the most extreme suffering, we retain the freedom to choose our attitude.

## The Humanistic Revolution

While the existentialists focused on the big philosophical questions, the humanists zeroed in on the therapeutic relationship itself.

**Carl Rogers** (1902–1987) revolutionized therapy with his **person-centered approach**. Rogers believed that the therapist's role was not to interpret or advise but to provide three core conditions: **unconditional positive regard**, **empathy**, and **congruence** (genuineness). When these conditions are present, Rogers argued, people naturally move toward growth and self-actualization.

**Abraham Maslow** (1908–1970) is best known for his **hierarchy of needs**, but his deeper contribution was the idea that psychology should study not just pathology but also human potential. He coined the term **self-actualization** to describe the drive toward becoming the fullest version of ourselves.

## The Living Tradition

**Irvin Yalom** (born 1931) brought existential therapy to a wider audience through both his clinical work and his bestselling novels. His textbook *Existential Psychotherapy* (1980) organized the field around four "ultimate concerns" that every human faces: **death**, **freedom**, **isolation**, and **meaninglessness**. Yalom's genius was making these abstract concepts feel immediate and personal.

## Why It Matters Today

In a world of quick fixes and algorithm-driven everything, humanistic and existential therapy offers something different: a space to slow down, reflect, and engage with the fundamental questions of your life.

It doesn't promise to eliminate your problems. It promises something better — to help you face them with greater clarity, courage, and self-understanding.

That's the kind of therapy I practice at Therapy Georgia. If you're curious, [get in touch](/contact/).
