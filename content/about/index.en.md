## Who I Am

I'm Giorgi Iremashvili, a humanistic and existential therapist practicing in Tbilisi, Georgia. I work with individuals who are navigating life transitions, searching for meaning, or simply feeling stuck.

My clients include expats adjusting to life in Georgia, international professionals dealing with the pressures of remote work and displacement, and Georgians who want a therapeutic space that goes beyond symptom management.

## My Approach

I practice **humanistic and existential therapy** — an approach that sees you as a whole person, not a collection of symptoms. Instead of diagnosing and prescribing, I create a space where you can:

- Explore your thoughts and feelings without judgment
- Understand the patterns that shape your life
- Confront the big questions — meaning, freedom, isolation, mortality
- Develop a deeper relationship with yourself

This approach draws on the work of thinkers like **Carl Rogers**, **Rollo May**, **Viktor Frankl**, and **Irvin Yalom**. It's grounded in the belief that awareness and authentic connection are the foundations of lasting change.

## What to Expect

Therapy with me is conversational, warm, and direct. There are no worksheets or homework assignments. Instead, we'll talk — honestly and openly — about what matters to you.

Sessions are 50 minutes, available both in-person in Tbilisi and online. Whether you come for a single session or commit to ongoing work, I'll meet you where you are.

## Qualifications

- Master's degree in Counseling Psychology
- Trained in humanistic and existential therapeutic approaches
- Experience working with international and multicultural clients
- Fluent in English and Georgian
